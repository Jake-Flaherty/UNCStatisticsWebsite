```{r inclusion, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

Indivi_Stats <- read_csv("UNC Roster Individual Febuary 6.csv")
Team_Stats <- read_csv("./23-24 UNC Team Stats - Sheet1.csv")
```

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}

FOW_Total <- sum(Indivi_Stats$FOW)
FO_Total <- sum(Indivi_Stats$FO)

## FaceOffs

> Our Tar Heel Hockey Team has a faceoff percentage of: ***`r FOPerc` %***
>
>> This is the percentage of total faceoff draws that we have won

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE}
BestFOTakers <- transmute(Indivi_Stats,
                          Player,
                           FOW,
                           FO,
            FOPercentage = round((FOW/FO)*100, digits=2)) %>% 
            subset(FO>25) %>%
            arrange(desc(FOPercentage)) 

FaceOffTable <- kable(head(BestFOTakers,5))

## Power Play and Penalty Kill

```{r PPPK, echo=FALSE}
# define df for penalty stats of all games
Penalty_DF <- transmute(Team_Stats,
                        PEN,
                        PIM,
                        PIMOPP,
                        PK,
                        PENOPP,
                        PP)

# variables to store percentages you want
PKPerc <- round((sum(Penalty_DF$PK)/sum(Penalty_DF$PEN)) * 100, digits = 2)
#print(PKPerc)
PPPerc <- round((sum(Penalty_DF$PP)/sum(Penalty_DF$PENOPP)) * 100, digits = 2)
#print(PPPerc)

# store variables for html later
PKTime <- sum(Penalty_DF$PIM)
PPTime <- sum(Penalty_DF$PIMOPP)

```
The team has killed ***`r PKPerc`%*** of penalties this season.

The team has scored on ***`r PPPerc`%*** of penalties against them this season.

### Minutes Spent on PP or PK
